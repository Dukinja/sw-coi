# How to Install and inject code

- Step 1: Create a folder and put `sw-coi.py` and `test.coi` in it. 

- Step 2: Put your coi code in `test.coi` and save the file. 

- Step 3: Put a Swordigo apk in the folder and rename it to `in.apk`

- Step 4: Execute the script, the script will inject the coi code of `test.coi` in the Swordigo APK. After executing you will get a apk named `out.apk` in the folder you created it. 

- Step 5: The `out.apk` is the apk in which the coi code is injected. 

- Step 6: Sign the APK using [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haibison.apksigner) or any other apk signer. 

- Step 7: Install the apk you just signed. 

ENJOY!
